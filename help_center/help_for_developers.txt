Hello developer!
To make any changes in the content of the site, you may change the HTML code in the "static" folder.
To change the content of the help center - you may enter the "help_center" folder.
In any case of repeated error, you might want to take a look in the server`s computer.
If the prisoner`s tab doesn`t measure locations, or doesn`t ask for permeation, you might want to enter "HTTPS" (secured) site. The Geolocation library works only on secured site, to protect its client.
The server built in a way that you can add more functions easily - you only need to create new function that return the wanted data, and an option to access it from the site.
In any other case, contact us.
